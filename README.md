# Apps for iOS that I've already created during studying iOS dev:

# 1)Checklists
App for handling lists of different deals that you are going to complete in future.App allows you to add,delete,edit checklists and items in them.They can also be configurated(for checklists-name and icon,for items-name and reminding in definite timestamp).If app is not launched,you will get local notification about deal in set timestamp.
